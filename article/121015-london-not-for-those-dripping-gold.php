    <p align="justify">Mr Galloway also fielded questions from the public on issues as diverse as fly-tipping, racism, anti-social behaviour, council tax and Uber, among others.<br><br>

The action follows a similar soapbox appearance at Harrow Mosque on Friday, October 9, where he addressed a crowd of thousands.<br><br>

He said: “Sadiq Khan wants to stand up to Jeremy Corbyn. Not me. I want to stand with Jeremy Corbyn, against austerity, against war, against David Cameron.</p><br>

<p align="justify">“Together we can build a London for all, not just for those dripping in gold”.

The action comes prior to a meeting being held on Wednesday, organised by campaign group ‘Harrow4Galloway’.

The Mayoral candidate will appear alongside Mukhtar Ghaffar, who is representing the RESPECT Party in the race for the Brent and Harrow GLA seat.</p>
