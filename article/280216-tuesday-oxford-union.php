<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">As I have said before, ISIS are, pretty much, the worst people I have encountered in my political life. If I am the Mayor of London, our police will be armed to the teeth, and will shoot dead any terrorist trying to harm innocent citizens. I will be out with the police regularly, and if I can I will pull the trigger myself.</p><br>

<blockquote><strong>I am second to nobody in my desire to see ISIS defeated. But it is incontestable that the West is responsible for the creation of ISIS. This has been acknowledged by no less than Tony Blair and Barrack Obama.</strong></blockquote><br>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">So I am second to nobody in my desire to see ISIS defeated. But it is incontestable that the West is responsible for the creation of ISIS. This has been acknowledged by no less than Tony Blair and Barrack Obama. Our culpability is both direct and indirect.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">Not only did we, along with the United States, destroy Iraq with our insane invasion in 2003, scattering to the four corners of the earth every institution needed for a functioning society.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">The same West and its allies have been pouring money, weapons and propaganda support for the rebels into the Syrian battlefields, all of which has ended up in the hands of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other such groups.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">To defeat ISIS we must give every support to the local forces fighting them in Syria and Iraq. The Iraqi and Syrian armies are winning their wars, and the last thing they need is Britain turning up to set fire to their countries once again.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">If I am Mayor, London will declare peace on the world. I will be a national voice, along with Jeremy Corbyn, demanding that we use our money to take care of our own people, of our pensioners who cannot heat their homes, rather than on playing imperial games abroad.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">And I will reverse all cuts to police and public transport workers which put our security at risk, making sure our city is protected from the very real threat posed by this death cult.</strong>.</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Upcoming events:</strong></p>

<p align="justify" style="color:#000000;">I will be making the following public appearances over the coming week:</p>
