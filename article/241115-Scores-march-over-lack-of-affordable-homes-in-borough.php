<p align="justify">The rally was organized over the lack of social housing in the area, with protestors stating the poorest families are being forced out of the borough.<br><br>

Linda Taaffe secretary of the trade union council said: “We want truly affordable rents.<br><br>

“That means a rent cap, and no privatization of council homes.”<br><br>

<blockquote>"Until we insist upon 50 per cent of all new projects in London being affordable housing, defined as 50 per cent of average rents in the area; until we begin a mass drive of council house building, we're not going to solve this crisis."</blockquote><br>

Mr Galloway added: "Until we insist upon 50 per cent of all new projects in London being affordable housing, defined as 50 per cent of average rents in the area; until we begin a mass drive of council house building, we're not going to solve this crisis."<br><br>

Galloway, a former MP and current mayoral candidate for the Respect party addressed the crowd from the top of a fire engine.<br><br>

The next meeting of Housing Action will be at the William Morris Community Centre on November 30, from 7pm.</p><br>
